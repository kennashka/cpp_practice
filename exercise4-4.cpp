/*


Instructions
The statements in the file main.cpp are in incorrect order.

Rearrange the statements so that they prompt the user to input:

The shape type (rectangle, circle, or cylinder)
The appropriate dimension of the shape.
Note: For grading purposes place the cylinder height statement before the radius statement.

The program then outputs the following information about the shape:

For a rectangle, it outputs the area and perimeter
For a circle, it outputs the area and circumference
For a cylinder, it outputs the volume and surface area.
Use 3.1416 as the constant value for any calculations that may need \piÏ€.

After rearranging the statements, your program should be properly indented.
